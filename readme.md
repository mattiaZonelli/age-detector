Age Prediction

* 3 models all trained with training set (2236 imgaes) and validation set (240 images):
  - 1 model with 10 output neurons;
  - 1 model with 20 output neurons;
  - 1 model output neurons;
  
Dataset:
ChaLearn LAP, Apparent age V1 (ICCV '15)

It uses a pre-trained VGG16 and does transfer learning and fine-tuning on age prediction. In this way, the training process should be faster and performances should be boosted.
